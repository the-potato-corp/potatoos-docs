Introduction
============

Welcome to the **Getting Started** guide for PotatoOS!

This section is designed to take you from a curious visitor to a functional user and application developer on the PotatoOS platform. By the end of this guide, you will know how to install PotatoOS, navigate its unique environment, and successfully run your first STARCH application.

System Requirements
-------------------
.. note::
    Since PotatoOS is built using the Godot Engine, the resource requirements are low, and portability is high.

* **Host Operating System:** Any major desktop OS supported by the Godot Engine (Windows, macOS, Linux, or BSD).
* **Storage Space:** A minimum of **50 MB** of free disk space is required for the PotatoOS application and the internal **PotatoFS** (virtual file system) structure.
* **Permissions:** You must have permission to run executable files on your host operating system and write files to the installation directory, but Administrator/root is not required.
