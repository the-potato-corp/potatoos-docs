Introduction
============


Welcome to the official documentation of the STARCH programming language, which powers PotatoOS.

.. code-block:: starch

    function main() {
        print("Hello, World!")
    }

This page shows information of the language and this documentation, so that you know where to start if you're a beginner, or where to look if you need some information.

Before you start
----------------

The :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started/index>` is a good place to go for tutorials. In case you have trouble with one of the tutorials or your project, you can find help on the `Discord <https://discord.gg/no_community_yet>`_ community.

About STARCH
------------

STARCH isn't just a programming language; it's an ecosystem. Its main purpose is to power PotatoOS, but it can also be used as a standalone language. PotatoOS is completely free and `open source <https://github.com/the-potato-corp/potatoos>`_.
